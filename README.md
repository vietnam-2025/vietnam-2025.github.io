## Codebase Structure Summary

Based on the files in the workspace, the codebase appears to be a static website project.

- **Core Content:** It consists mainly of HTML files (`01.html` through `12.html`, `index.html`, `vietnam-timeline.html`), suggesting a multi-page structure, possibly with sequential content and a timeline feature. `index.html` likely serves as the entry point.
- **Project Files:** Standard files like `README.md` (project information), `LICENSE` (licensing), and `.gitignore` (Git configuration) are present.
